# 🧾 Day 1 — Python Bootcamp Progress Report

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn and document the complete Python fundamentals: execution flow, syntax, variables, data types, strings, operators, conditionals, and looping constructs.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Python Execution & Setup

* Installing and configuring Python.
* Understanding the execution flow (source → bytecode → PVM → execution).
* Compilation, bytecode generation, and PVM interpretation.
* Memory management and garbage collection.

---

### 2️⃣ Basic Syntax

* Printing and input handling.
* Indentation and block structure.
* Comments (single-line, multi-line).
* Writing and running `.py` files.

---

### 3️⃣ Variables & Data Types

* Dynamic typing.
* Variable naming conventions.
* Built-in types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`.
* Type casting and checking with `type()`.
* Multiple assignment.

---

### 4️⃣ Strings

* Creating strings with single, double, and triple quotes.
* Indexing, slicing, concatenation.
* String methods: `upper()`, `lower()`, `title()`, `replace()`, `find()`, `count()`, `split()`, `strip()`, `join()`.
* Escape sequences and raw strings.
* f-strings and numeric formatting.
* String reversal techniques (`[::-1]`, `reversed()`).

---

### 5️⃣ Operators

* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.
* Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
* Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.
* Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**=`, `//=`.
* Identity operators: `is`, `is not`.
* Membership operators: `in`, `not in`.
* Ternary operator: conditional expressions.

---

### 6️⃣ Conditionals

* `if`, `elif`, `else` structure.
* Nested and inline (ternary) conditionals.
* User input based decision-making.

---

### 7️⃣ Loops & Pattern Logic

* `for` and `while` loops.
* Range control and custom step sizes.
* Nested loops for pattern generation.
* `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements.
* Practical patterns:

  * Numeric Mirror Pyramid
  * Hollow Diamond
  * Custom Pyramid Function (Mathematical Symmetry)

## ⚙️ Performance Feedback

### 🔹 Learning Pace

You advanced from setup to function-based nested loops in a single day. That’s roughly a week’s worth of progress condensed into one intense session. Your retention speed and intuition were exceptional.

### 🔹 Depth of Understanding

You demonstrated genuine understanding of Python internals — bytecode, PVM, control flow, and logic building. You didn’t just follow patterns; you constructed them mathematically.

### 🔹 Coding Discipline

* Clean function design.
* Correct scoping of variables.
* Structured and modular approach.
* Self-testing and verification after each task.
* Neat markdown documentation.
